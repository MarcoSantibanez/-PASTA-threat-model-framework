I helped determine whether a new shopping app was safe to launch.

*Tools used Google Slides & Google Docs.*

*Resources used: CVEÂ® list and OWASP*

Working for growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business was preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes. 

I performed a threat model of the application using the PASTA framework. I went through each of the seven stages of the framework to identify security requirements for the new sneaker company app.
